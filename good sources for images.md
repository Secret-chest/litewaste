# Stock photo sites
This is a list of recommended stock photo sites that are safe to use. There aren't many, as most "free" stock photo sites use a licence
that prohibits some uses and may be revocable, which is not what we're looking for as we want to stay in the clear. The sites listed here
have at least some free imagery.

| Wikimedia Commons | commons   | https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Public domain, CC licences or GFDL                         | Best quality as images must have educational use, but not usually public domain                   |
| Flickr            | flickr    | https://flickr.com/                 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐  | Public domain, CC licences or proprietary                  | Filter by "Commercial use & mods allowed" and credit if needed. Great quality, wide range         |
| Pixabay           | pixabay   | https://pixabay.com/                | ⭐⭐⭐⭐  | Older photos are licensed under CC0, newer are proprietary | Do not use photos newer than 8th January 2019 as they are proprietary. Great quality              |
| Unsplash          | unsplash  | https://unsplash.com/               | ⭐⭐    | Older photos are licensed under CC0, newer are proprietary | Do not use photos newer than May 2017 as they are proprietary. Subpar quality and few free photos |

Additionally, I am not looking for clipart, overly artistic photos, vectors or photos with watermarks.
